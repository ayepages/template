To activate this script within an HTML document: First include the external JavaScript file, "keyboard.js" and stylesheet, "keyboard.css" within the document's <head> element (download links to the right).

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://greywyvern.com/code/javascript/keyboard.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://greywyvern.com/code/javascript/keyboard.css">

Then, to enable a graphical keyboard interface on any particular text field or textarea, simply apply to it the keyboardInput class, like so:

<input type="text" value="" class="keyboardInput">
